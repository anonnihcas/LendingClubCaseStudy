## General Information
- Background: The data shared is from a Consumer Finance company specializing in lending various types of loans. The data consist of 39717 rows spread across 111 columns. One of the columns indicates whether the loan is currently Ongoing, Fully Paid or Charged Off.
- Problem to be solved: Identify patterns based on the columns which would be used to reject/deny loans, reduce the loan amount or charge higher interest rate.
- We have used the Loan Data Set and the associated Data Dictionary to solve the problem.

## Conclusions
- Borrowers whose dti values lie between 5 â€“ 25 are more likely to default with max defaulters like between 15-20.
- Borrowers who live in Rented homes or paying mortgages are more likely to     default. 
- Grades 'B','C','D' and 'E' have higher defaults as compared to 'A','F' and 'G'. Within these grades, there are no huge variations observed with these plots.	
- Borrowers from large urban cities are less likely to default than in rural areas.  This indicates more of rural distress.
- Loan amount for charged off loans span between 900 - 35K. Analysis of loan data indicates many are smaller loan size, with more defaults happening between USD 0-7000 followed by 7K-14K and 14K-21K.
